\description{
Power for case-control association design
}
\details{
This is a revised version of \code{\link[gap]{pbsize}} which is appropriate for
a case-control design under a range of disease models. Essentially, for given sample
size(s), a proportion of which (fc) being cases, the function calculates power estimate
for a given type I error (alpha), genotype relative risk (gamma), frequency of the
risk allele (p), the prevalence of disease in the population (kp) and optionally a
disease model (model). A major difference would be the consideration of case/control
ascertainment in \code{\link[gap]{pbsize}}.

Internally, the function obtains a baseline risk to make the disease model consistent
with Kp as in \code{\link[gap]{tscc}} and should produce accurate power estimate. Note it
provides power estimates for given sample size(s) only.

\note{
Why is the comparison with power.casectrl so bad?
