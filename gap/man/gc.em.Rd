\usage{
gc.em(
  data,
  locus.label = NA,
  converge.eps = 1e-06,
  maxiter = 500,
  handle.miss = 0,
  miss.val = 0,
  control = gc.control()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix of alleles, such that each locus has a pair of
adjacent columns of alleles, and the order of columns
corresponds to the order of loci on a chromosome. If
there are K loci, then ncol(data) = 2*K. Rows represent
alleles for each subject.}

\item{locus.label}{Vector of  labels  for  loci,  of  length  K  (see definition of data matrix).}

\item{converge.eps}{Convergence criterion, based on absolute  change in log likelihood (lnlike).}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations of EM.}

\item{handle.miss}{a flag for handling missing genotype data, 0=no, 1=yes.}

\item{miss.val}{missing value.}

\item{control}{a function, see \link{genecounting}.}
}
\value{
List with components:
\itemize{
\item converge Indicator of convergence of the EM algorithm (1=converged, 0 = failed).
\item niter Number of iterations completed in the EM alogrithm.
\item locus.info A list with  a  component for each locus.  Each
component is also a list, and  the  items of a locus-
specific list are the locus name and a vector for the
unique alleles for the locus.
\item locus.label Vector of labels for loci, of length K (see definition of input values).
\item haplotype Matrix of unique haplotypes. Each row represents a
unique haplotype, and the number of columns is the number of loci.
\item hap.prob Vector of mle's of haplotype probabilities.  The ith
element of hap.prob corresponds to the ith row of haplotype.
\item hap.prob.noLD Similar to hap.prob, but assuming no linkage disequilibrium.
\item lnlike Value of lnlike at last EM iteration (maximum lnlike if converged).
\item lr Likelihood ratio statistic to test no linkage disequilibrium among all loci.
\item indx.subj Vector for index of subjects, after  expanding  to
all possible  pairs  of  haplotypes  for  each person. If
indx=i, then i is the ith row of input matrix data. If the
ith subject has  n possible  pairs  of haplotypes that
correspond to their marker phenotype, then i is repeated n times.
\item nreps Vector for the count of haplotype pairs that map to
each subject's marker genotypes.
\item hap1code Vector of codes for each subject's first haplotype.
The values in hap1code are the row numbers of the unique
haplotypes in the returned matrix haplotype.
\item hap2code Similar to hap1code, but for  each  subject's  second haplotype.
\item post Vector of posterior probabilities of pairs of
haplotypes for a person, given thier marker phenotypes.
\item htrtable A table which can be used in haplotype trend regression.
