\title{Obtain correlation coefficients and their variance-covariances}
\usage{
b2r(b, s, rho, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{b}{the vector of linear regression coefficients.}

\item{s}{the corresponding vector of standard errors.}

\item{rho}{triangular array of between-SNP correlation.}

\item{n}{the sample size.}
}
\value{
The returned value is a list containing:
\describe{
\item{r}{the vector of correlation coefficients}
\item{V}{the variance-covariance matrix of correlations}
}
}
\description{
This function converts linear regression coefficients of phenotype on
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into Pearson correlation coefficients
with their variance-covariance matrix. It is useful as a preliminary step
for meta-analyze SNP-trait associations at a given region. Between-SNP
correlations (e.g., from HapMap) are required as auxiliary information.
